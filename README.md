## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Mariana and I'm studying Human Systems Engineering with a focus on User experience at Arizona State University. After graduation, I'm hoping to work on creating and improving user experiences as a UX researcher or product manager. 

My technical skills include low and high fidelity wireframes, mockups, and prototypes within figma, as well as a basic understanding of html, css and javascript. I'm also well versed in user research including analyzing quantitative and qualitative data to pinpoint user frustrations in currently used platforms. 

In my free time, I mainly see family, read fiction, and travel.
